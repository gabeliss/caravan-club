            <h3 className="day-title">Day 1: Sedona</h3>
            <p><strong>Morning:</strong> Begin the day by driving from the airport to Sedona.</p>
            <p><strong>Afternoon:</strong> Once you've settled into your accommodation, venture into town and take a stroll into all the shops. There’s a great Art & Shopping Area called Tlaquepaque, fashioned after traditional Mexican villages. There’s a nice Chai Shop to sip on some tea. Most likely, you won’t arrive to Sedona until mid-afternoon, so take the afternoon easy and enjoy the town.</p>
            <p><strong>Night:</strong> Grab a bottle of wine or a small picnic and make your way to Cathedral Rock. Hike up the rock and enjoy drinks while watching the sunset. You might even see people dancing and singing on the top of the hike. Once you finish, head back to downtown and grab dinner at at Hideaway House, a casual eatery offering stunning views.</p>
            <p><strong>Accommodations:</strong>  I've lodged at both Pine Flat Campground and the Big Hit Sedona Airbnb. Camping or glamping options in Sedona are somewhat limited, but this campsite served its purpose. It's conveniently situated right outside downtown. While not particularly secluded, it offered a flat area for setting up camp and a pleasant space for cooking dinner. The Airbnb was much closer to downtown and most of the well known hikes.</p>
            <p>Pine Flat Campground West ($25/night), Tiny Home ($160/night for 2 guests), Birdsong Casita ($230/night for 4 guests), Cozy&Zen Airbnb ($350/night for 6 guests), Big Hit Sedona ($499/night for 8 guests), Casa De Los Cedros ($450/night for 6 guests), Uptown Gem! ($570/night for 7 guests)</p>

            <h3 className="day-title">Day 2: Sedona</h3>
            <p><strong>Morning:</strong> Wake up bright and early to hike The Subway via Boynton Canyon. This cave is 2.4 miles into the trail. The cave is not marked on the trail, so make sure to download all-trails, so that you can see where you are heading. It gives the coolest views through a cave. This hike will require you to go up a steep incline to get to the cave, but the views are worth it. Make sure to get up early for this one, it gets pretty busy. An alternative hike is Airport Loop Trail, a 3.3 loop hike, which gives you panoramic views of downtown Sedona and as well as the mountains. If you aren’t into steeper climbs, I would opt in for the loop trail. Parking was full, so we parked at Sunset Park and cut into the trail.</p>
            <p><strong>Afternoon:</strong> After you’re done with the hike and worked up an appetite. Head over to Hill Top Deli or Sedona Memories for a casual sandwhich for lunch. or Head over to Indians Gardens Cafe & Market for some fresh lunch and enjoy on their outside patio.</p>
            <p><strong>Night:</strong> Head to your Pink Jeep Tour for sunset, which will take you around the remote backcountry of Sedona. Giving you views like no other. There are multiple options to choose from between length and terrain. All experiences will give you an amazing time. Then head back to the accommodations, make some dinner, and relax.</p>

            <h3 className="day-title">Day 3: Sedona</h3>
            <p><strong>Morning:</strong> Hike Devil’s Bridge via Dry Creek Road, an iconic 3.9 mile that takes you to the largest natural sandstone arch in Sedona. Parking at the trailhead is limited and this trail gets busy, so be sure to get there early or take the free shuttle ride service within central Sedona. We were hiking by 8 AM and there were still a decent amount of people on the trail and we had to park down the street. I’d advise not getting there any later unless you want to wait in line to stand on the bridge.</p>
            <p><strong>Afternoon:</strong> Sedona is known to having numerous energy vortexes, so it’s the perfect time to head to The Center For The New Age to try out a physic session, aura photo, or medium session in the afternoon. We met with Andrea and AJ for our group reading, which was a super fun experience. If the energy exploring isn’t your thing, head over to Winery 1912 for a wine tasting or to Slide Rock State Park, a natural water slide formed by nature depending on the time of year this is a fun activity for all ages. Entrance fee is around $20-30 per vehicle depending on the season. Once you finish your afternoon activity, head back to the campsite, shower off and get ready for dinner.</p>
            <p><strong>Night:</strong> Tonight marks your final evening in Sedona, so make your way to Mariposa or Elote Cafe for a memorable dinner. These fantastic spots are perfect for savoring your last night in this stunning area.</p>

            <h3 className="day-title">Day 4: Grand Canyon</h3>
            <p><strong>Morning:</strong> Rise and shine for an early start to the Grand Canyons (South Rim)! The drive takes about 2 hours. or Head over to Indians Gardens Cafe & Market for some fresh lunch and enjoy on their outside patio. Upon arrival, stop at the visitor center to park your car and pick up a map of the park. Hop on the shuttle to take you to South Kaibab Trailhead.</p>
            <p><strong>Afternoon:</strong> Start your afternoon on the South Kaibab Trail stopping at Ooh Aah Point hike (1.8 miles) or continue onward to Cedar Ridge (3 miles). Both lookouts offer breathtaking canyon views. Make sure to get on the trail early, especially in summer, as shade is limited. Keep in mind, whatever distance you hike into the canyon, you'll need to trek back up. Pack a picnic and enjoy lunch at the lookout. Overall, this hike is an amazing taste of the Grand Canyons.</p>
            <p><strong>Night:</strong> Return to your accommodations to prepare dinner and unwind after a long day of adventure. Just before the sun begins its descent, drive back to the visitor center park and walk to Mather Point. You'll witness a stunning sunset painting the canyon ridge and on a clear day you will be able to see 30+ miles —a truly breathtaking sight.</p>
            <p><strong>Accommodations:</strong> Having stayed at both Mather Campground  and Kachina Lodge, I found Mather Campground particularly appealing. Situated on the South Rim, it's one of my favorite campgrounds due to its proximity to hikes and breathtaking views close by. The camping spots are easily accessible and offer great spaces to cook dinner, set up a hammock, and simply relax and unwind in nature. Kachina Lodge, positioned incredibly close to the park, provides direct canyon views, offering an excellent accommodation option if camping isn't ideal due to the season or preferences. It's a perfect spot to stay, allowing you to still enjoy stunning views and easy access to the beauty of the area without camping.</p>

            <h3 className="day-title">Day 5: Grand Canyon & Scottsdale</h3>
            <p><strong>Morning:</strong> Start your day by heading to Canyon Village Market & Deli for a breakfast wrap. Food choices are a bit limited in the park, so don’t expect anything too glamorous. Once you're fueled up, head to Bike Grand Canyon to rent bikes (prices range from $30 to $55 depending on the amount of time) and enjoy riding along the rim.</p>
            <p><strong>Afternoon:</strong> Once you've returned the bikes, it's time to say goodbye to the park. Prepare for a 3.5-hour drive back to Scottsdale. Enjoy the scenic journey back and reminisce about the incredible experiences at the Grand Canyon.</p>
            <p><strong>Night:</strong> After a long day, take the evening and head back to your accommodations for a well-deserved rest. Pick up some pizza at </p>

            <h3 className="day-title">Day 6: Scottsdale</h3>
            <p><strong>Morning:</strong> Begin your day by hiking Camelback Mountain a very popular 2.6 point to point trail to start off your morning. This hike requires some bouldering at the top of the mountain, but the views are amazing. We decided to hike Camelback via the Cholla Trail which was 3 miles round trip and supposedly less steep than Echo Canyon route. Once you finish, head to scottsdale for brunch at Alo Cafe or Morning Squeeze. Both spots provide delightful brunch menus alongside the choice of outdoor dining.</p>
            <p><strong>Afternoon:</strong> Discover the charm of Scottsdale by taking a leisurely stroll through its vibrant streets, exploring various art shops, and indulging in some shopping.</p>
            <p><strong>Night:</strong> Return to your accommodations and prepare for an evening out in Scottsdale. Later, grab a drink at Outrider Rooftop Lounge on top of the Canopy Hotel to enjoy a drink with sunset views of downtown then head to Malee’s Thai for a delicious dinner.</p>

            <h3 className="day-title">Day 7: Scottsdale</h3>
            <p><strong>Morning:</strong> Final day in Scottsdale! Begin with a morning hike at Quartz Ridge Trail for scenic views of both nature and downtown. Parking is limited, so be aware. Then, stop by FourtillFour for a coffee.</p>
            <p><strong>Afternoon:</strong> In the afternoon, prepare for an outing at the Quarter, a fantastic outdoor shopping mall with great restaurants and stores. We spent hours exploring and shopping.</p>
            <p><strong>Night:</strong> For the evening, dine at Culinary Dropout at the Quarter—a lively restaurant with a fantastic atmosphere, live music, and plenty of energy. Book ahead if you plan to visit on a weekend. We secured a table quickly thanks to our reservation. Enjoy the dinner and reminisce on the great adventure over the past week!</p>
